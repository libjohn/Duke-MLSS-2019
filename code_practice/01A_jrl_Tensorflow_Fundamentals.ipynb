Why do we need it? Why can't we do deep learning with pure Python or `numpy`? To answer these questions, you need to understand the problems TensorFlow trying to solve.\n","\n","### Python's limitations\n","Python is what's known as a _dynamically typed_ programming language. This means that while your program is running, it stores in memory (alongside each variable) information about a variable's type. When you run `x + y` in Python, for example, Python's runtime looks up `x`'s type, `y`'s type, then figures out how to add those two things together, or throws an error if it doesn't know how. (For example, try adding a list and a string.) This is called a _runtime type check_. \n","\n","This automatic bookkeeping makes Python a pleasure to use, but also leads to inefficiencies. If we store a long list of numbers, for instance, we must allocate memory not just for the data itself but for each number's metadata (type information). If we then want to _sum_ the list, using a loop, for instance, we need to do type checks for every addition operation we perform. This makes pure Python nearly unuseable for processing large datasets.\n","\n","### Numpy for fast arithmetic\n","That's where `numpy` comes in. In pure Python, a list is a Python object that holds other Python objects, each with its own metadata. The `numpy` package, on the other hand, exposes a new kind of list, called a _`numpy` array_, that holds values _all of the same type_. Since a `numpy` array must hold values only of one type, we can store the metadata _once_ for the whole array, instead of separately for each element. \n","\n","Furthermore, since `numpy` array elements are all of one type, they are all guaranteed to be the same size in memory, which allows us to store them more compactly and access them more quickly. (In pure Python, if you stored all elements \"next to each other\" in memory, it would be costly to calculate, say, where in memory the 100th item started, as this would depend on the sizes of each previous object. So Python actually stores elements all over the place in memory, then keeps an \"index\" of the memory locations of each element of the array. This means to sum 100 elements, Python needs to look in the index 100 times and go all over your RAM to find the numbers you want to add. Numpy just stores the 100 items in a row, and since they're all the same size, it's easy to calculate where the 5th or 100th or 1000th item is pretty much instantly.) \n","\n","In addition to this compact array type, `numpy` provides a number of operations, implemented in C, that manipulate these arrays, taking advantage of their compact representation. Arrays can be multidimensional, so when we talk about operations on arrays, that includes what you might think of as matrix operations (like fast matrix multiplication) too.\n","\n","`numpy` is wonderful, and enables Python programmers to work efficiently with vast amounts of data. It is the foundation of higher-level packages like `pandas` and `scipy`. But `numpy`'s design choices make certain tradeoffs; `tensorflow` makes a different set of choices and accordingly has a different set of tradeoffs.\n","\n","### Downsides of numpy\n","Even though single `numpy` operations are blazing-fast, when _composing_ `numpy` operations, things can get a bit slower, because between each operation, you still have to go back and forth between Python's intepreter and `numpy`'s C code. Especially when inspecting `numpy` values using, say, `print`, or logging them to files, you incur a cost, because a full translation must be made between the `numpy` value you are converting and the corresponding pure Python type that can interact with other Python code.\n","\n","The second downside of `numpy` really applies only to deep learning applications. The classic algorithm for training a deep model is (stochastic) gradient descent using backpropagation, which requires taking lots of derivatives. Before TensorFlow and other similar libraries, programmers manually (i.e., using pen and paper) did the calculus, deriving the symbolic gradient of the function to be minimized, then writing special code to take partial derivatives at an arbitrary input point. This is mechanical work that a computer should be able to do automatically. But `numpy`'s structure does not provide an easy way of computing these derivatives automatically. Why? Automatically computing the derivative of some formula requires having some representation of that formula in memory. But when you run `numpy` operations, they simply execute and return their results; no trace is left of the steps used to get from first input to final output. There is no easy way to go back and compute derivatives later on in a program.\n","\n","### Enter TensorFlow\n","TensorFlow solves both these problems with the idea of a **computation graph**. Unlike in `numpy`, where  data goes back and forth between Python and C for each operation, in TensorFlow, the programmer creates, in pure Python, an object-oriented representation of the entire computation she wishes to perform. This representation is called a \"graph,\" in the graph theory sense: the nodes in the graph are operations, and the edges represent the data flowing from one operation to the next. Building the graph is like writing down a formula. No data is actually being processed. As such, all of TensorFlow's graph-building functions are lightweight and fast, simply creating a description of computation in memory. Once the graph is complete, it is sent to TensorFlow's low-level execution algorithm. That algorithm, written (like much of `numpy`) in C and C++, performs _all_ the requested operations at once, then returns any values of interest (as specified by the user) back to the Python world.\n","\n","Because an entire graph of computation is processed at once, there is much less shuttling back and forth between one representation and another. And because the computation graph is essentially an in-memory record of every step used to compute each value in your program, TensorFlow is able to do the necessary calculus automatically, computing gradients based on the structure of that graph."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lZxLL-i-0ds9","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## The default graph, operations, and tensors"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SNNEhfN70ds_","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Let's get started by importing TensorFlow."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"R9DziJVu0dtB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import tensorflow as tf"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f-LVO9n60dtJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Even before you call your first TensorFlow function, a lot is going on behind the scenes.

Typically, rather than use Gradient Descent, we use _Stochastic_ Gradient Descent, which means that instead of taking gradients of the loss computed on _all_ our data _every_ iteration, we feed in a small \"batch\" of data to the graph each iteration of training. This is more efficient, lets us handle large datasets, and provably converges to a local minimum just like normal Gradient Descent. To use this technique, we need placeholders: each time we call `sess.run`, we'll pass in different data.)\n","2.
